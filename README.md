- Later on go into more complex setup
- Layout system setup with basic components, database
- Split databases appropriate for different types of data
- Explain your decision making proactively. Its not about perfection. Its about contribution and collaboration.
- Talk through the use cases to check your design (test the design) and identify bottlenecks.
- Think about different solutions to identified bottlenecks.
- Identify existing technologies like CDN, Caching, Load Balancing
- Discuss how solutions such as caching apply at different levels in solution.
- Load balancing is not one size fits all.
- Consider multiple metrics when applying technologies such as load balancing.
- Be open about the limits of your expertise.
- Wrap up by outlining how the system design meets the provided requirements & think big and see future scalability and growth of the design.
